git-shim(1)
============

NAME
----
git-shim - Helper programs for interoperation with remote git

SYNOPSIS
--------
'git shim-<transport>' <remote>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

These programs are normally not used directly by end users, but are
invoked by various git programs that interact with remote repositories
when the repository they would operate on will be accessed using
transport code not linked into the main git binary.

COMMANDS
--------

Commands are given by the caller on the helper's standard input, one per line.

'list'::
	Lists the refs, one per line, if the format "<value>
	<name>". The value is either a hex sha1 hash or "@<dest>" for
	symrefs. After the complete list, outputs a blank line.

'fetch' ref::
	Fetches the given ref, writing the necessary objects to the
	database. Outputs a blank line when the fetch is complete.
+
If a fatal error occurs, the program writes the error message to
stderr and exits. The caller should expect that a suitable error
message has been printed if the child closes the connection without
completing a valid response for the current command.
